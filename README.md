# luffy_project
The project is about image classification using convolutional neural network.

## Prerequisites
Before we start you need these python library installed in your system.
    
    1.TensorFlow
    2.NumPy
    3.OpenCV
    4.Gradio

@ After installing required libraries.
> download the project in your system.

> then open "py.ipynb" in your jupyter notebook or you can also use visual studio.
	>you need to keep these file"(8521.model),(py.ipynb)" together.

> run the "py.ipynb" you will have two link(your system gonna work as server )
	1.local URL:"run only in your system"
	2.public URL:"run everyware"
> copy the "local URL" and paste it in your browser(run only in your system).

> if you want to run this project apart from your system then just use the "public URL"
  though "public URL" you can use this on different devices for instance you phone.

> Now upload a image from these category
    1.dog			       
    2.airplane
    3.car
	4.frog
	5.horse
	6.priate ship

> You can also drag and drop the images if you are using pc.

> click submit and hope for the appropriate output text that will correspond to the image.

> why hope for the appropriate output text?
        ""because its not perfect""
